# Introcourse Project App for the iPraktikum - Muhammed Enes Deniz

To pass the introcourse, you need to create your own unique iOS app (based on SwiftUI).

There are no requirements regarding the functions of your app, so you can get creative.
However, we provide you with Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) that your app needs to fulfill.

After each day of learning new Swift and SwiftUI concepts, these NFRs may change, or new NFRs get added.


## Submission procedure

You get a **personal repository** on Bitbucket to work on your app.

Once you implemented a new feature into your app, you need to create a Pull Request (PR) to merge your changes from the feature branch into your main branch.

Your tutor will review your changes and either request changes or approves the PR. 

If your PR got approved, you also need to merge it!

### Deadline: **19.04.2023 12:00**
Until the deadline all of your PRs **need to be merged** and your final app **needs to fulfill** all of the requested NFRs!
